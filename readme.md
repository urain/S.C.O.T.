This tool has the ability to bruteforce valid SKUs from the 
Star Citizen store. Why? Dunno. You can find hidden SKUs sometimes
and if you are awaiting the release of a ship, instead of refreshing
the webpage you can simply loop adding the ship SKU to your cart.

To use this tool you need to fill-in the _rsi_device, Rsi-Token, and X-Rsi-Token
from a valid session. You can find these values from the cookie while
you're on robertsspaceindustries.com
