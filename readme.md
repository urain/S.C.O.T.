This tool has the ability to bruteforce valid SKUs from the 
Star Citizen store. Why? Dunno. You can find hidden SKUs sometimes
and if you are awaiting the release of a ship, instead of refreshing
the webpage you can simply loop adding the ship SKU to your cart.

To add a ship SKU to the cart repeatedly you need to modify the file. I'll
leave that up to you.

To use this tool you need to fill-in the _rsi_device, Rsi-Token, and X-Rsi-Token
from a valid session. You can find these values from the cookie while
you're on robertsspaceindustries.com You also need a valid SKU for the 
ship you want (you can find it by inspecting the page of the ship you want.)
