# This tool has the ability to bruteforce valid SKUs from the 
# Star Citizen store. Why? Dunno. You can find hidden SKUs sometimes
# and if you are awaiting the release of a ship, instead of refreshing
# the webpage you can simply loop adding the ship SKU to your cart.

# To use this tool you need to fill-in the _rsi_device, Rsi-Token, and X-Rsi-Token
# from a valid session. You can find these values from the cookie while
# you're on robertsspaceindustries.com
